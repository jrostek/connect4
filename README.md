# Connect Four

A simple game you already know, for two players - get four 
"x"s or "o"s in a vertical or horizontal line and win!

For now, you can only play the boring, console version. I plan to add 
fireworks (a pretty design, that is) later. To try it out, simply write
```commandline
uvicorn main:app
```
